# Summoned

_Summoned_ is a Victorian role-playing game in the style
of H. P. Lovecraft. It is [my entry](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=5885) to [Ludume Dare 29](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/).
It was originally developed in an internal Mercurial repository; this public GitHub repository is a copy of the latest version.
